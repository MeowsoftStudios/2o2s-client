# 2o2s-client
An open source hack client that is basically Wurst (a Fabric mod/hack), but all in one! (as a client with it and some other useful mods)
# Wait, what is Wurst?
go chek it out at https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/Wurst7 or https://www.wurstclient.net/
# How do i install?
Well we're gonna have a seperate branch for releases, so you should watch for some. Also, you could build the project with gradle but just keep in mind we ARE doing the hard work for you.
# Why the heck is it named 2o2s?
Well, it's a bad 2b2t mix up. 2open2source client. Except the fact you can't use it on 2b2t because the mods we're bundling in here are mostly 1.16.x, with no backwards compatibility. So no, we're not backporting it. (unless we do)
